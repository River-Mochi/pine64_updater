## üñ•Ô∏è Install Options

- Download the newest Windows or Mac binaries from the [releases here](https://github.com/pine64/pine64_updater/releases).
- Windows: use `PINE64.Updater.Windows.3.zip` (for all 32/64) [reference](https://github.com/pine64/pine64_updater/issues/41#issuecomment-1159680531).
- Works for [original](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Pinecil#Authenticity) Pinecil V1 sold by Pine64 before August 2022 and uses DFU for firmware.


## üîñ Notes
- If you have Linux, try alternate [PineFlash here](https://github.com/River-Mochi/PineFlash)
- Does not work for any Pine64 Pinecils sold after Aug. 1, 2022 because Pine64 switched to a new MCU chip that needs BLISP flasher.
- New Pinecils require [Blisp flasher here](https://github.com/pine64/blisp) because they have a BL706 MCU chip with BLE bluetooth.

## üìñ References
- [Pinecil Wiki](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Pinecil) has the Firmware instructions and many details on Pinecil.
