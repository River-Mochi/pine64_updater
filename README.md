# üñ•Ô∏è Install Options

- Download the newest Windows or Mac binaries from the [releases page here.](https://github.com/pine64/pine64_updater/releases)
- Works for original Pinecil V1 sold by Pine64 before August 2022 and uses DFU for firmware.
- If you have Linux, try [PineFlash here](https://github.com/River-Mochi/PineFlash)

# Notes
- Does not work for any Pine64 Pinecils sold after Aug. 1, 2022 because Pine64 switched to a new MCU chip that needs BLISP flasher
- Pinecil V2 models require a different flasher because of the new MCU chip (BL706 with BLE bluetooth). Pinecil V2 [Bouffalo flashers are here](https://github.com/pine64/blisp).

# üìñ References
- [Pinecil Wiki](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Pinecil) has many details on V1/V2 with links to the [Live Community Chat channels](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Pinecil#Live_Community_Chat). Firmware instructions are also on Pinecil Wiki.
